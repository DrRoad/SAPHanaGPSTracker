Real Time GPS Tracker using SAP HANA XS, SAPUI5, Cordova Geolocation Plugin and OData

I would like to share how to build a simple Android app GPS tracker powered by SAP HANA using XS, SAPUI5 with Cordova Geolocation Plugin and ODATA. The idea is to send the latitude and longitude position from the Android phone to the SAP HANA. The backend web application will show  the current location in Google Map.
